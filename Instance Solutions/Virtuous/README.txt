Well hello there. You may be thinking where is all the work the team did? Good question, well we didn't use any data directly, we instead built an 'awesome' Alexa skill using AWS Lambda (index.js) and spent lots of time configuring AWS through the interface (no code for that i'm afraid). We really emphasised the idea and practical implementation details, but were limited by time in how much we could build.
